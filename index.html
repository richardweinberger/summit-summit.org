            <p>The even takes place from 2022-06-10 to 2022-06-12 at the
               <a href="https://www.lizumerhuette.at/g-l-u-n-g-e-z-e-r-h%C3%BCtte-reservierung/">Glungezer
               H&uuml;tte</a> (lodge) near Innsbruck, Tyrol,
               Austria. The lodge is reachable only by foot.</p>

            <p>And here is a
               <a target="_blank" href="https://glungezerbahn.at/de/livecam/">webcam</a>
               showing the current weather situation.</p>

            <p>In case the weather or snow condition do not allow us
               to go the logde we stay in Innsbruck. We will arrange
               the hotel and meeting location if that is the case.<p>

              <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>The closest airport is
               <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innsbruck-airport.com">Innsbruck</a>.
               Another option is the airport in
               <a target="_blank" href="http://www.munich-airport.de">Munich</a>
               which is approx. 2 hours by car from Innsbruck.</p>

            <h3>Hotels</h3>
            <p>Since the lodge is a few hours by foot from
               civilization, staying at the lodge strongly
               recommended.</p>

            <p>First and most important: yes there is power available
               and we will have Internet access. It will not be fast,
               but checking for some emails it should be okay.</p>

            <p>You should have a pair of good hiking shoes (This is
               really important!). It is not a difficult path just in
               case the weather is nasty. Also a rain jacket is thing
               to bring with you.</p>

            <p>It also a good idea to bring your own sleeping bag. If
               you don't have one it is not a problem.  There are
               blankets available at the lodge but usually they are
               not washed after each usage...</p>

            <p>A hiking backpack should be enough to bring clothes and
               other equipment with you for 3 days.</p>

            <p>Food and drinks are available at the lodge. The hike to
               the lodge is around 2 hours (7 km). So it is not
               particular long but you might want to bring some
               water or food with you.</p>
